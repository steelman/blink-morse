#+TITLE: Blink some Morse

This is a yet another very basic blinking program. It uses attiny-hal
from [[https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/][avr-hal]] to blink an LED attached to the 2nd pin of ATtiny85. The
purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the most basic setup for
a program written in Rust for an ATtiny85 ÂµC. Just run =cargo build=
and you will find =target/avr-attiny85/debug/blink-morse.elf= ready to
be uploaded with [[https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude][avrdude(1)]].

Building for different AVR microcontrolers is left as an excersise to
the reader.
